Best laptop for Machine Learning

New technologies are constantly evolving, and in order to survive in this cutthroat industry, it's important to stay on top of the latest trends. Artificial intelligence or AI is a hot thing in the market right now and it needs professionals to do it. There's a piece of that technology, machine learning, the next big thing in technology.

Factors to Consider Before Buying a Laptop
The following are important factors that a user should keep in mind before making a purchase:

Processor: Analyzing huge data requires a powerful device. Therefore, it is important to have a good processor. You shouldn't choose anything less than a Core i5 for your processor, although we recommend a Core i7 for best performance.
RAM: This is another factor to consider. Better RAM helps you analyze more data without interrupting your system. We recommend 32GB of RAM, although you can opt for anything at least 16GB.
Storage: Good storage improves overall system performance. So, we recommend a laptop with 1 TB of memory, but you can choose anything equal to or greater than 512 MB.

Machine learning refers to the study and analysis of a huge amount of data using a powerful device. So, for machine learning purposes, a user needs a good laptop where they can easily store a bunch of data and analyze it. In this article, we will discuss the factors to consider when buying a machine learning laptop, as well as the best laptops for it.

Lambda has partnered with Razer to launch the Tensorbook, a machine learning laptop. It comes with dedicated software and has impressive performance figures for its line of work.

The novelty is equipped with a 15.6-inch diagonal display with a resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels and supports a refresh rate of 165 Hz. Lambda TensorBook is based on the Intel Core i7-11800H processor. It is equipped with 64 GB DDR4 RAM, 2 TB SSD and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 (Max-Q) discrete graphics with 16 GB GDDR6 VRAM.

The equipment includes two Thunderbolt 4 ports, three USB Type-A, HDMI 2.1, a microSD card slot, a combo 3.5mm audio jack and a 1080p webcam.

The laptop ships with Ubuntu Linux 20.04 LTS, the Lambda Stack software package, and tools such as PyTorch, Tensorflow, CUDA, and cuDNN. In addition, a configuration with an additional installed Windows OS and the same set of machine learning tools is provided. The Lambda TensorBook is claimed to offer four times the performance in machine learning tasks of devices based on the Apple M1 Max chip with a 32-core GPU.

The price in the specified configuration is 3499 dollars.
